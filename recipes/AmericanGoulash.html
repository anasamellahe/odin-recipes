        American goulash was one of my all-time favorite comfort food meals when I <br>
        was growing up. They served it in my school cafeteria alongside a slice of <br>
        buttered white bread and a carton of milk. This Americanized version of goulash <br>
        was invented to stretch a small amount of beef into enough food for a not-so-small <br>
        small family. It's a simple dish that doesn't taste simple, so it's perfect for your weeknight dinner rotation. <br>
